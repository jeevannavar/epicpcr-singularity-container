https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/admin-guide/installation.html

# Clone the epicpcr repository to get the snakemake file / Download snakemake file (the pipeline)
git clone https://github.com/jeevannavar/epicpcr-singularity-container.git

# Move into folder
cd epicpcr-singularity-container

# Make the setup script an executable and run it
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Run the snakemake pipeline
singularity run container.sif snakemake --cores all report


## Extra
## If you would like to shell into the singularity container and then run commands from inside there, you can use the following command
singularity shell container.sif

## If working on windows using a vagrant virtual box, you might run into an insufficient memory problem (Fatal error: Unable to allocate enough memory) at some point. In this case, use instructions here (https://ostechnix.com/how-to-increase-memory-and-cpu-on-vagrant-machine/) to increase memory allocated to the vagrant machine)
